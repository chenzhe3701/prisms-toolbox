The folder contains a MATLAB script that generates part of the modification to slip system resistance based on the micro Hall-Petch equation given an input periodic microstructure, for basal and prismatic slip systems. The modification included in the output files are read into PRISMS-CPFE and multiplied with the corresponding micro Hall-Petch multipliers which is added to the size-independent component of the slip system resistance.
